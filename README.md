# JavaScript Concepts

A project consisting of unit tests illustrating some useful JavaScript concepts.

## Arithmetic Operations
I found that JavaScript doesn't always give perfectly rounded figures.

## Loops
You can declare a function level variable in the initialization block of a for loop using the  var keyword. Using const or let would mean the variable is scoped to the loop.

For in loops generally should not be used unless the number of properties on an object is unknown.
